## 🧰 Redux State Management

Global state handled using **Redux Toolkit slices**:

* `authSlice`
* `productsSlice`
* `cartSlice`
* `checkoutSlice`
* `orderSlice`
* `adminSlice`
* `adminProductSlice`
* `adminOrderSlice`

Async logic handled with **createAsyncThunk** — no messy code here.

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

* JWT-based authentication
* Protected routes for users
* Admin-only middleware
* Secure password handling
* Role-based access control

You can seed the database using:

```bash
node backend/seeder.js
```

Perfect for testing & development.

## 🛠️ Environment Variables

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
```
